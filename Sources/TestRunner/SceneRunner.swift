/**
 * `SceneRunner` is a class that "plays" through scenes like a playlist.
 * - Description: `SceneRunner` is a utility class that sequentially
 *                executes a series of scenes, which are types conforming to
 *                `SceneKind`. It can be used to simulate a sequence of events
 *                or actions in an application, making it a useful tool for
 *                automated testing or demoing purposes.
 * - Note: It is a subclass of `ArrayIterator` with `SceneKind.Type` as the
 *         generic parameter.
 * - Note: It also conforms to `SceneRunnerKind` protocol.
 * ## Examples:
 * SceneRunner(scenes: [LoginScene.self, LogoutScene.self]) { Swift.print("All scenes completed üèÅ") }.iterate(callBack: { _,_  in })

    *             optionally accepts a test case for integrating with XCTest

    * - Description: This initializer is used to create an instance of
    *                SceneRunner. It takes a sequence of scenes, an optional test
    *                case, and a completion handler as parameters. The sequence
    *                of scenes is an array of types conforming to `SceneKind`
    *                which represents the scenes to be executed. The optional
    *                test case can be used for additional testing capabilities
    *                during scene execution. The completion handler is invoked
    *                when all scenes in the sequence have been completed.
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Consider adding support for launch options to customize the
    *          app's launch configuration.
    * - Parameters:
    *   - sequence: An array of `SceneKind.Type` representing the scenes
    *               to be executed.
    *   - onComplete: A callback that is invoked when all scenes in the
    *                 sequence have been completed.
    *   - testCase: An optional `XCTestCase` instance that can be used for
    *               additional testing capabilities during scene execution.
